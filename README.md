# Professional Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio to showcase my projects and skills that I cultivate during the UW Coding Bootcamp. I use a wireframe to plan out my website design. Currently this shows my use of HTML and CSS to create the framework of a webpage. I have a strong interest in front-end design. This represents 20+ hours of work pushing the boundaries of my knowledge to attempt more advanced CSS styling to create an aesthetic and responsive website.
